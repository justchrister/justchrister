Nice to meet you! People call me Christer. Iâ€™m a digital project manager, and cloud architect. I like to call it a "Digital Architect" but that isnt a thing, yet. And my real title is IT manager, so, yeah. 

I am currently working on two "projects", [Omoji](https://kalt.co/Omoji) an Emoji competitor, lol, and [Kalt](https://kalt.co/) a non-company company.
