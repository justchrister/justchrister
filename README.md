<h1>justchrister</h1>

Nice to meet you! People call me Christer. I’m a digital project manager, and solutions architect. I like to call it a "Digital Architect" but that isnt a thing, yet.

I am currently running a startup called <a href="https://kalt.co">Kalt</a> that is working to blitzscale the transition to fossil-free energy.


Hit me up on Discord; christer#0001 or at christer@ka.lt
