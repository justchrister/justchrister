Im christer, a digital project manager, and solutions architect. I call it a *Digital Architect*. But that isnt a thing, yet. 

Currently building a startup — <a href="https://ka.lt">Kalt</a> — a niché investment platform, where you buy shares in fossil-free energy infrastructure and earn dividends when energy is generated and sold.
