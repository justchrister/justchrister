# Anarchy as system architecture

In an ever-evolving tech landscape, businesses need flexible and scalable system architectures to stay ahead. Anarchy as a system architecture offers a unique approach to achieving this. Inspired by the principles of Clean Architecture by Robert C. Martin, this model emphasizes a decentralized and flexible framework where components are connected through a messaging system. In this architecture, services can freely subscribe and publish to the message bus, fostering adaptability and resilience.

## Messaging system
A robust message bus allows components to subscribe and publish, enabling easy communication and coordination between services ðŸ“¨

## Functions for reading and writing to topics
Standardizing the reading and writing of topics through general utility functions ensures a consistent approach, making a complex archtecture easier to work with for all parties. 
### Getting a message
```
messaging.get(client, entityId)
```
### Posting a message
```
messaging.post(client, topic, {
  // message content
})
```

## External system adapters
Each adapter is dedicated to a single topic, ensuring clean and modular connections between external systems and the message bus. This approach requires multiple adapters for systems that interact with multiple topics, promoting separation of concerns ðŸ”Œ

Adapters should not maintain their own state, further reducing complexity and ensuring the messaging system remains the primary source of truth

## Microservices

### Localized data storage
Each service maintains its own database for all its required information, ensuring that data is stored and managed efficiently and independently.

Embracing anarchy as a system architecture can lead to increased flexibility, adaptability, and scalability. The decentralized nature of this approach encourages services to operate autonomously while still benefiting from a shared messaging system. This ultimately enables teams to build more resilient, modular, and adaptable systems, ready to tackle the challenges of the rapidly evolving technology landscape.
