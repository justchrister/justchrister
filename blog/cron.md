## Problem — why cron jobs suck
1. Rigid time-based schedules 🕰️
2. Artificial coupling between tasks and time ⛓️
3. Complications: resource contention, unexpected side effects, task failures 🤕
4. Configuration headaches: time zones, daylight saving changes ⏰
5. Coupling in Time
6. Unnecessary Complications

## Solution — Event triggers

User-driven events:
-Dynamic and adaptive 🎯
