# cron jobs < triggers 🚀

## Problem — why cron jobs suck
1. Rigid time-based schedules 🕰️
2. Artificial coupling between tasks and time ⛓️
3. Complications: resource contention, unexpected side effects, task failures 🤕
4. Configuration headaches: time zones, daylight saving changes ⏰
5. Coupling in Time
6. Unnecessary Complications

## Solution — Event triggers

User-driven events:
- Dynamic and adaptive 🎯
- Reduces unnecessary load ⚡️
- No more "wait 5 mins and it should sync"
- Or "that job runs every six minutes, and takes 10 minutes cause it syncs hundreds of user changes"

System events:
- Greater control and flexibility 🕹️
- Oh, a new transaction happened, lets get the most recent exchange rates.
- Easier adaptation to changing requirements 🔄

## Conclusion: 
It's time to move on from cron jobs and embrace the future of event-driven triggers for more efficient, responsive, and scalable applications. 🚀
- Leverage services like Supabase, Vercel, Netlify, etc 
- Robust, efficient, and scalable applications 🌟
