# Listen to the kids

It's essential to listen to and learn from younger people. They are the only ones that can offer fresh perspectives, bold ideas, and an innate understanding of today's technology and culture. By embracing their insights, we foster innovation, bridge generational gaps, and cultivate a more inclusive society that thrives on the exchange of knowledge and experiences.

- Fresh perspectives: Younger people bring unique viewpoints and creative solutions to the table.
- Technological expertise: They have grown up with technology we have not, making them more valuable than us.
- Inclusive society: Please believe, we are most likely bigotted still.
