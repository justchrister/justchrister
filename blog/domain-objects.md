## Introduction

Business environments today always become a complex collection of internal code and external systems, where strategic data distribution is a critical component of effective development and operations. To meet the demand for swift and robust integration and introduction of new micro services,  I have developed the concept of a 'domain object', a high-level abstraction that encapsulates the entirety of any entity within a business domain. This entity, depicted as an object, becomes a vital part of the the adapter+service pattern. This essay explores the 'domain object' concept, its role in defining contracts and messaging within and beyond applications, and the impact of its deployment on business operations.

## The 'domain object' and the adapter+service pattern

The adapter+service pattern is a design approach where the 'domain object' holds a pivotal role. In this context, the 'domain object' introduces a system wide implicit anti-corruption layer, which provides a safeguard against data corruption. The data distribution architecture is established by a stringent prerequisite: the unique identifier (ID) is the only mandatory field, which enables distribution of partial or complete 'domain objects', ensuring integrity during data distribution.

In terms of real-world application, consider a global logistic firm with numerous data points related to shipments. Each shipment can be viewed as a 'domain object' with the shipment ID as the only mandatory field, while other details like origin, destination, delivery status etc., vary according to the requirements of different subsystems. Each subsystem can add data to each of the shipments, and the adapters that communicate with other external services are the ones that define their required fields for distributing the data to the external services. 

The microservices can subscribe to partial domain objects, and distribute new messages with enriched content (for instance upgrade status of field X, Y, Z meets a set of requirements)

It is all based on a ledger pattern, where you can read the entire current state from the message logs, instead of keeping state in each adapter or microservice-even though it is permitted to keep state if you need data from multiple sources or if performance requirements makes that the go-to.

## 'Domain object' in action: Improved interoperability and data distribution

The 'domain object' concept, with its unique design and inherent flexibility, supports enhanced interoperability and improved data distribution across systems in a business domain. The encapsulation of a complete object within a domain standardizes the way data is distributed, enabling a smoother interaction between different systems.

A real-world scenario illustrates this. Think about a modern supply chain network where a 'domain object' may embody all data pertaining to a product â€” right from manufacturing to sales data. This 'domain object' becomes a standardized unit of data that is distributed across different systems involved in the supply chain. The mandatory requirement of the unique ID allows different stakeholders to distribute varying degrees of product data based on their operational needs, leading to an optimized supply chain process.

Another service with an endpoint only for environmental data can deliver a domain object subset as its external contract, where only the id, name and environemnetal impact data is included. 

## Conclusion

So, when you stumble upon architectural deviations, remember: "If you have to deviate from the architecture, the architecture sucks". In the world of business systems, the 'domain object' offers a paradigm shift. Through its integration within the adapter+service pattern, it creates an inherent anti-corruption layer, securing the data distribution and thereby enhancing the integrity of operations. It breaks down complex entities into manageable pieces with a single binding factor: the unique ID.

And, despite its high level of abstraction, it remains deeply grounded in real-world applications, effectively bridging the gap between strategic abstraction and practical implementation. In essence, the 'domain object' paves the way for more cohesive, efficient, and optimized business operations across diverse industries, with a clear message: "we're not saving the planet, we're saving ourselves from a shitty future. Get to work."
