# Simply priority

In project management, it's crucial to strike a balance between simplicity and effectiveness. Adopting a streamlined priority system with just three levelsâ€”low, medium, and highâ€”is that exact balance. By reducing the complexity of prioritization, teams can focus on execution and delivering value to stakeholders rather. This simplified approach reduces decision fatigue and helps maintain a clear, focused direction for project work.

By using a universal language of low, medium, and high priorities, team members can easily understand and align their efforts, ensuring that everyone is working towards the same goals. This structure also facilitates more effective resource allocation, as it makes it extremely easy to identify tasks requiring immediate attention and which can be deferred. Ultimately, a simplified priority system enables teams to stay nimble, adapt to changes more effectively, and deliver successful outcomes for their projects.

The concept of focusing on a limited number of tasks aligns with the principles of OKR (Objectives and Key Results), a goal-setting framework used by successful companies like Google. Thought leaders in productivity and focused work, such as Tim Ferris, author of "The 4-Hour Workweek," and Cal Newport, author of "Deep Work," emphasize the importance of concentrating on the most critical tasks to achieve meaningful results. By limiting your focus to just three prioritized tasks per two weeks, you can ensure that your team is working on what truly matters and making a real impact.

To ensure a sustainable and effective workflow, it's important to distribute tasks according to their priority level. Aim for roughly 80% of tasks to be low priority, 15% medium priority, and only 5% high priority. This distribution enables your team to continuously focus on what's truly important, while reducing cognitive load during high-priority tasks. Instead of constantly juggling numerous high-priority tasks, your team can allocate time and resources more effectively, addressing the most critical items when they have the capacity to do so. This approach fosters a more balanced, focused, and productive work environment.
