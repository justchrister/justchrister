In project management, the key to effectiveness lies in simplicity. By introducing a two-tiered priority systemâ€”p1 and p2 strikes the ideal balance. This approach minimizes complexity, enabling teams to focus more on execution and less on decision-making. It streamlines team efforts, ensuring everyone is aligned and working towards common goals.

Such clarity in prioritization not only simplifies decision-making but also enhances resource allocation. By clearly identifying which tasks need immediate attention and which can wait, teams can adapt quickly and respond effectively to changes, leading to better project outcomes.

Key benefits include:

* Clarity: A universal priority language ensures all team members understand and collaborate efficiently.
* Efficient Resource Allocation: Simplifying priorities allows for targeted deployment of resources to the most critical tasks.
* Increased Adaptability: A straightforward system enhances flexibility, making it easier to adjust to new challenges.

Embracing this simplified system parallels the principles of OKR (Objectives and Key Results), advocating focus on essential tasks for maximum impact, as championed by productivity experts like Tim Ferris and Cal Newport. 

To optimize workflow, distribute tasks across the priority spectrum: 15% p1, 35% p2, other tasks? Later. This strategy focuses energy on the most impactful tasks right now, reducing overload and boosting productivity. This level of clarity and focus is essential in order to reach the escape velocity and for the flywheel effect to kick in. Ultimately, successful leadership involves deciding what not to do, and prioritizing effectively is a cornerstone of this philosophy. 

PS Remember, ideas should not linger in the backlog but have a designated space for active consideration, such as a well thought out lean business case.
