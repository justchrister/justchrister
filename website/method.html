      <h3>"Managing modes"</h3>
      <p>
        I've tried working with solely "top-level management" where you define strategies and guidelines without diving deeply into the day‐to‐day decision making. After having tried this approach on-and-off for a few years, it has become apparent that, while it can give you some work-life balance, it does not allow you to make the right decisions.
      </p>
      <p><strong>do</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>High involvement across all areas</li>
        <li>Focus on big-picture tasks, product-market fit, and key decisions, with all the details.</li>
        <li>Encourages autonomy, but always step in during crucial moments to guide or course-correct.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>dont</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Delegate tasks without having an opinion on outcome and output</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Founder mode</h3>
      <p>
        Popularized by Brian Chesky from AirBnB, this mode describes a leader who is deeply involved in all aspects of the business due to necessity – essentially how founders of successful startups work. This type of hyper-involvement is what I apply on a daily basis.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>High involvement across all areas</li>
        <li>Focus on big-picture tasks, product-market fit, and key business decisions with all the details.</li>
        <li>Driven by a sense of responsibility and long-term vision, while scaling processes over time.</li>
        <li>Encourages autonomy in the team but always steps in during crucial moments to guide or course-correct.</li>
        <li>Continuous follow-up and support, so everyone feels comfortable making decisions day-to-day.</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Not micromanagement</h4>
      <p>
        Micromanagement is a style where a leader excessively controls every detail of the team's work. In my variation of founder mode, you should understand the details, but delegate the decisions themselves. Micromanagement focuses on trivial details rather than the broader vision, which wastes time and stifles creativity.
      </p>
      <h4>Downside</h4>
      <p>
        It means you will be working an excessive amount and have to be available 16 hours a day to unblock and make decisions.
      </p>
      <h4>In practice</h4>
      <p>
        I set the intention for the week in the Monday commits and keep a priority list per person so that they are aware of what is most pressing. This priority list is monitored and potentially adjusted 3-4 times a day.
      </p>
      
      <h3>Manager mode</h3>
      <p>
        A passive leadership style where the leader operates as a bureaucratic overseer, detached from the team's day-to-day work and innovation. Manager mode is the death of efficiency and innovation, leaving team members overwhelmed and confused.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Characteristics</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Delegates tasks without proper follow-up or support, leaving the team to make mistakes without guidance.</li>
        <li>Fails to engage deeply with the team's challenges, often waiting until problems become significant before stepping in, or only addressing issues from a high-level view.</li>
        <li>Obsessed over poorly defined performance metrics and "top-level" reports, losing sight of the nuances of the team's efforts and creativity.</li>
        <li>Avoids taking responsibility for failures, pushing accountability onto the team while offering little direction.</li>
        <li>Prioritizes adherence to rules, procedures, and hierarchy at the expense of flexibility, stifling individual initiative and ownership.</li>
        <li>Manages reactively, focusing on putting out fires and hitting immediate goals rather than fostering long-term growth or improvement.</li>
      </ul>
      <aside>
        Manager mode might be useful in huge, mainly operational businesses, but that is not the kind of place I want to work.

      <h2>Leading feature deliveries</h2>
      <h3>Feature roadmap</h3>
      <p>
        
      </p>
      <h3><strong>Avoid bloat</strong></h3>
      <h3>Scope</h3>
      <p>
        In the design and planning phase of a feature delivery, there is no need to spend excessive time creating a framework. Sometimes it should start with a business case or a design document for review.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          At the early stages, it's especially important to scope projects. Design projects so that they can be completed in 1–3 weeks with a team of 1–3 people. Smaller fixes or additions (paper cuts) should take only hours or a day. – Linear Method
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        You need to answer two critical questions in the design phase:
      </p>
      <h4><strong>Measurement</strong></h4>
      <p>
        <em>Which outcome do we want?</em> Clearly defined criteria for when we've succeeded in delivering the feature and how success is measured. This is heavily inspired by the OKR framework and supported by the meeting structure.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>O</strong> — singular, objective (outcome)</li>
        <li><strong>KR</strong> — one to three key results (metric)</li>
      </ul>
      <h4><strong>Estimation</strong></h4>
      <p>
        How fast can the feature be delivered given the available resources and prerequisites?
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Financial (X)</strong> — Enough cash to make mistakes and course correct</li>
        <li><strong>Talent (Y)</strong> — Always a 100% commitment from the talent required to deliver the feature</li>
        <li><strong>Blockers and enablers (Z)</strong> — Do other features need to be delivered by a certain date for this to work?</li>
        <li><strong>Other (Ø)</strong> — Any other important considerations</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2>Dev/delivering phases</h2>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          In preparing for battle, I have always found that plans are useless, but planning is indispensable – Dwight D. Eisenhower
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <h3>Sub-phases</h3>
      <p>
        All sub-phases can be multiplied by n. You can proof-of-concept multiple parts and move one part to MVP before the others. This "make it work, make it great" attitude allows developers to focus on applied functionality before perfecting theoretical aspects. The full delivery from POC to CVP should be possible within 1 to 3 weeks.
      </p>
      <h4>POC - proof-of-concept</h4>
      <p>
        The goal is to validate the feasibility of a feature or idea from a technical or business standpoint. The scope should be extremely limited, focused on proving core functionality without building a full product. Each iteration should take 1-2 days, and the phase should last only a week.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Do:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Introduce major tech debt</li>
        <li>Introduce manual tasks in processes</li>
        <li>Mock services that don't exist yet</li>
        <li>Allow minor test coverage</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>MVP - minimal viable product</h4>
      <p>
        Launch a basic version of the feature that is functional enough for users to engage with and provide feedback on its core value.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Do:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Bloated logging</li>
        <li>Manual processes</li>
        <li>Introduce high interest tech debt during development, then remove before deployment</li>
        <li>Introduce low interest tech debt during development, note it for the CVP phase</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Dont:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>None to some test coverage (focus on testing behavior, not just implementation)</li>
        <li>None to high limits on infrastructure costs (introduce alerts if budgets are tight)</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>CVP - commercially viable product</h4>
      <p><strong>Do:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Implement test coverage</li>
        <li>Apply performance improvements</li>
        <li>Establish monitoring and alerting</li>
        <li>Automate processes and ensure scalability</li>
        <li>Remove all high-interest tech debt</li>
        <li>Decrease all low-interest tech debt</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Dont:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Don't go back through the two-way door and entirely change the strategy</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2>The pulses (sprints)</h2>
      <h3>Planning</h3>
      <p>
        I don't even sprint-plan; instead, everyone in the team has a relationship with the current priorities and deadlines. I open and close sprints on a weekly basis to monitor task progress. It's more Kanban than traditional sprint planning.
      </p>
      <h3>Tasks</h3>
      <p>
        Epics, stories, bugs, tasks, and features are all just tasks. The person completing the task fills in the details.
      </p>
      
      <!-- Meetings Section -->
      <h2>Meetings</h2>
      <p>
        In my opinion, meetings suck — especially when they're scattered throughout the day. I keep my calendar open for ad-hoc problem solving and deep work.
      </p>

      <!-- Communication Section -->
      <h2>Communication</h2>
      <h3>Teams</h3>
      <p>
        The communication pattern within and across teams is crucial.
      </p>
      <h3>Stakeholders</h3>
      <p>
        Avoid the "what's the status of this feature" questions by having defined reports on a set schedule and meeting points to align on priorities.
