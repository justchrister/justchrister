      <h2>Intro</h2>
      <p>
        I have an inherent animosity towards rigid methodologies. They often fail to reflect real-world applications unless the entire business, including its decision-making and budgeting processes, aligns with that specific methodology. Often introducing methodologies turns into bureaucracy and an extreme headache.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          Any organization that designs a system will produce a design whose structure is a copy of the organization's communication structure – Melvin Edward Conway
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        This has informed my approach to creating my own <strong>anti-methodology</strong> or <strong>meta-methodology</strong> based on many different methodologies and proven real world approaches, rather than theory. It is not just a team or product leading framework but an all-encompassing approach to your day-to-day life, with practical advice, from meeting structure to ways to decrease stress and avoid burnout.
      </p>
      
      <!-- How i lead Section -->
      <h2>How i lead</h2>
      <h3>"Managing modes"</h3>
      <p>
        I've tried working with solely "top-level management" where you define strategies and guidelines without diving deeply into the day‐to‐day decision making. After having tried this approach on-and-off for a few years, it has become apparent that, while it can give you some work-life balance, it does not allow you to make the right decisions.
      </p>
      <p><strong>do</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>High involvement across all areas</li>
        <li>Focus on big-picture tasks, product-market fit, and key decisions, with all the details.</li>
        <li>Encourages autonomy, but always step in during crucial moments to guide or course-correct.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>dont</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Delegate tasks without having an opinion on outcome and output</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Founder mode</h3>
      <p>
        Popularized by Brian Chesky from AirBnB, this mode describes a leader who is deeply involved in all aspects of the business due to necessity – essentially how founders of successful startups work. This type of hyper-involvement is what I apply on a daily basis.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>High involvement across all areas</li>
        <li>Focus on big-picture tasks, product-market fit, and key business decisions with all the details.</li>
        <li>Driven by a sense of responsibility and long-term vision, while scaling processes over time.</li>
        <li>Encourages autonomy in the team but always steps in during crucial moments to guide or course-correct.</li>
        <li>Continuous follow-up and support, so everyone feels comfortable making decisions day-to-day.</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Not micromanagement</h4>
      <p>
        Micromanagement is a style where a leader excessively controls every detail of the team's work. In my variation of founder mode, you should understand the details, but delegate the decisions themselves. Micromanagement focuses on trivial details rather than the broader vision, which wastes time and stifles creativity.
      </p>
      <h4>Downside</h4>
      <p>
        It means you will be working an excessive amount and have to be available 16 hours a day to unblock and make decisions.
      </p>
      <h4>In practice</h4>
      <p>
        I set the intention for the week in the Monday commits and keep a priority list per person so that they are aware of what is most pressing. This priority list is monitored and potentially adjusted 3-4 times a day.
      </p>
      
      <h3>Manager mode</h3>
      <p>
        A passive leadership style where the leader operates as a bureaucratic overseer, detached from the team's day-to-day work and innovation. Manager mode is the death of efficiency and innovation, leaving team members overwhelmed and confused.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Characteristics</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Delegates tasks without proper follow-up or support, leaving the team to make mistakes without guidance.</li>
        <li>Fails to engage deeply with the team's challenges, often waiting until problems become significant before stepping in, or only addressing issues from a high-level view.</li>
        <li>Obsessed over poorly defined performance metrics and "top-level" reports, losing sight of the nuances of the team's efforts and creativity.</li>
        <li>Avoids taking responsibility for failures, pushing accountability onto the team while offering little direction.</li>
        <li>Prioritizes adherence to rules, procedures, and hierarchy at the expense of flexibility, stifling individual initiative and ownership.</li>
        <li>Manages reactively, focusing on putting out fires and hitting immediate goals rather than fostering long-term growth or improvement.</li>
      </ul>
      <aside>
        Manager mode might be useful in huge, mainly operational businesses, but that is not the kind of place I want to work.

      <!-- Leading feature deliveries Section -->
      <h2>Leading feature deliveries</h2>
      <h3>Feature roadmap</h3>
      <p>
        The feature roadmap should include the three top-level phases and be kept updated on a weekly basis.
      </p>
      <h3>Feature timeline</h3>
      <p>
        The feature timeline should include all parts of the delivery and can have drift at any given moment.
      </p>
      <h3><strong>Avoid bloat</strong></h3>
      <p>
        A key to fast deliveries is to scope the project down to its minimal parts, phasing the deliveries to get something out quickly while postponing as many decisions as possible.
      </p>
      <p>
        Not being tempted by what Karri Saarinen of Linear calls <em>side quests</em> (the cool things you might want to do, like a new loading animation) and understanding what is truly important — rather than what Jeff Bezos of Amazon and Blue Origin refer to as <em>paper cuts</em> (small tasks that, while not huge features, are pain points in the user journey) — is essential.
      </p>
      <h3>Scope</h3>
      <p>
        In the design and planning phase of a feature delivery, there is no need to spend excessive time creating a framework. Sometimes it should start with a business case or a design document for review.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          At the early stages, it's especially important to scope projects. Design projects so that they can be completed in 1–3 weeks with a team of 1–3 people. Smaller fixes or additions (paper cuts) should take only hours or a day. – Linear Method
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        You need to answer two critical questions in the design phase:
      </p>
      <h4><strong>Measurement</strong></h4>
      <p>
        <em>Which outcome do we want?</em> Clearly defined criteria for when we've succeeded in delivering the feature and how success is measured. This is heavily inspired by the OKR framework and supported by the meeting structure.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>O</strong> — singular, objective (outcome)</li>
        <li><strong>KR</strong> — one to three key results (metric)</li>
      </ul>
      <h4><strong>Estimation</strong></h4>
      <p>
        How fast can the feature be delivered given the available resources and prerequisites?
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Financial (X)</strong> — Enough cash to make mistakes and course correct</li>
        <li><strong>Talent (Y)</strong> — Always a 100% commitment from the talent required to deliver the feature</li>
        <li><strong>Blockers and enablers (Z)</strong> — Do other features need to be delivered by a certain date for this to work?</li>
        <li><strong>Other (Ø)</strong> — Any other important considerations</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2>Dev/delivering phases</h2>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          In preparing for battle, I have always found that plans are useless, but planning is indispensable – Dwight D. Eisenhower
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <h3>Sub-phases</h3>
      <p>
        All sub-phases can be multiplied by n. You can proof-of-concept multiple parts and move one part to MVP before the others. This "make it work, make it great" attitude allows developers to focus on applied functionality before perfecting theoretical aspects. The full delivery from POC to CVP should be possible within 1 to 3 weeks.
      </p>
      <h4>POC - proof-of-concept</h4>
      <p>
        The goal is to validate the feasibility of a feature or idea from a technical or business standpoint. The scope should be extremely limited, focused on proving core functionality without building a full product. Each iteration should take 1-2 days, and the phase should last only a week.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Do:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Introduce major tech debt</li>
        <li>Introduce manual tasks in processes</li>
        <li>Mock services that don't exist yet</li>
        <li>Allow minor test coverage</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>MVP - minimal viable product</h4>
      <p>
        Launch a basic version of the feature that is functional enough for users to engage with and provide feedback on its core value.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Do:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Bloated logging</li>
        <li>Manual processes</li>
        <li>Introduce high interest tech debt during development, then remove before deployment</li>
        <li>Introduce low interest tech debt during development, note it for the CVP phase</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Dont:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>None to some test coverage (focus on testing behavior, not just implementation)</li>
        <li>None to high limits on infrastructure costs (introduce alerts if budgets are tight)</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>CVP - commercially viable product</h4>
      <p><strong>Do:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Implement test coverage</li>
        <li>Apply performance improvements</li>
        <li>Establish monitoring and alerting</li>
        <li>Automate processes and ensure scalability</li>
        <li>Remove all high-interest tech debt</li>
        <li>Decrease all low-interest tech debt</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Dont:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Don't go back through the two-way door and entirely change the strategy</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2>The pulses (sprints)</h2>
      <h3>Planning</h3>
      <p>
        I don't even sprint-plan; instead, everyone in the team has a relationship with the current priorities and deadlines. I open and close sprints on a weekly basis to monitor task progress. It's more Kanban than traditional sprint planning.
      </p>
      <h3>Tasks</h3>
      <p>
        Epics, stories, bugs, tasks, and features are all just tasks. The person completing the task fills in the details.
      </p>
      
      <!-- Meetings Section -->
      <h2>Meetings</h2>
      <p>
        In my opinion, meetings suck — especially when they're scattered throughout the day. I keep my calendar open for ad-hoc problem solving and deep work.
      </p>
      <img src="https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/09cabd9b-9728-4ee9-9e8b-e0cf01af8aeb/2bd49b39-b91e-4759-b571-a65f50036377/Frame_2.jpg" alt="Meeting illustration">
      
      <!-- Communication Section -->
      <h2>Communication</h2>
      <h3>Teams</h3>
      <p>
        The communication pattern within and across teams is crucial.
      </p>
      <h3>Stakeholders</h3>
      <p>
        Avoid the "what's the status of this feature" questions by having defined reports on a set schedule and meeting points to align on priorities.
      </p>
      
      <!-- Framework Section -->
      <h1 id="f">the framework</h1>
      <h2>Intro</h2>
      <p>
        As a full time product and team lead, startup founder, friend and family member, my life requires extreme focus, close to perfect deliveries, and quality time with the people that matter. In order to achieve this, I've developed a lightweight system and framework to ensure I have the time, and energy to actually be present and efficient.
      </p>
      <h2>Personal goals</h2>
      <p>
        Everything I do is goal-driven—focused on doing little instead of doing a lot decently, derived from books such as The Effective Executive and the hedgehog concept from Good to Great by Jim Collins.
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Focus on your strengths, not your weaknesses.</li>
        <li><em>The hedgehog concept</em> is finding the intersection of three key areas to create a clear, focused strategy: what you are deeply passionate about, what you can be the best in the world at, and what drives your economic engine.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        The goals are designed to keep you focused on what will matter in the long term—both work-related and as prerequisites for reaching your professional and personal aspirations.
      </p>
      <h3>Long term</h3>
      <p>
        These are your 10-year goals, adjusted annually. They inform every activity you prioritize and should lean more towards the personal side, with professional goals supporting them.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Own and operate a successful business with a positive impact on society and the environment</li>
        <li>Married to someone I love</li>
        <li>Cool home on some hill</li>
        <li>Happy alone to be happy around anyone</li>
        <li>Decrease suffering in all living organisms</li>
        <li>Friends that share my interests</li>
        <li>Leading my life with love</li>
        <li>Healthy, mentally and physically</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Medium term</h3>
      <p>
        Medium-term goals serve as stepping stones, bridging your daily efforts with your long-term vision. They typically span 6 to 9 months and provide clear, actionable milestones that build momentum toward your 10-year horizon.
      </p>
      <h3>Short term</h3>
      <p>
        These are day-to-day tasks designed to incrementally move you closer to your medium-term objectives, as further outlined in the personal performance optimization section.
      </p>
      
      <h2>Personal performance optimization</h2>
      <h3>Triaged priorities</h3>
      <p>
        The most effective way to maintain radical focus is by triaging tasks. By consistently evaluating and categorizing tasks, I ensure that at any given moment I know exactly what to focus on for the greatest impact.
      </p>
      <h4>Structure</h4>
      <p>
        It is a dumping ground for tasks without overthinking their description, whether it's a copy-paste from a Slack message or a more detailed note.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Deadlines:</strong> Every task has a visible deadline so I never forget commitments made during calls or casual texts.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Status:</strong> Only tasks in "to do" and "in progress" are visible.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Priority:</strong> Tasks are prioritized based on a combination of deadline and impact.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Focus filter:</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Only show deadlines within the next 7 days</li>
        <li>Display work-related tasks during work hours and personal tasks when off work</li>
        <li>Sort tasks based on a combination of deadline and priority</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>No low impact tasks</h4>
      <p>
        About 50% of tasks are immediately set to "don't," meaning they won't be prioritized and are effectively removed.
      </p>
      <p>

      </p>
      <p>
        Summary: By filtering away low to no impact tasks, I stay focused on what truly matters. While this approach may frustrate some, it ensures that my efforts remain aligned with long-term goals and priorities.
      </p>
      <p>
        Get the Notion template <a href="https://www.notion.so/1055e6dacb958053aa35ce3d6184c88c?pvs=21">here</a>.
      </p>
      
      <h3>Time management</h3>
      <p>
        To start each day with intention, I review both my personal and work-related calendars and block out time for deep work, shallow work, and personal tasks in Notion.
      </p>
      <p>
        The time-boxing schedule consists of three columns:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>timeslot</strong>: A specific block of time designated for a task.</li>
        <li><strong>activity</strong>: The planned task or activity for that time slot.</li>
        <li><strong>adjusted</strong>: A flexible option if priorities shift.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This method ensures that while I plan my day in detail, I'm not locked into a rigid schedule. If a higher-priority task arises, I adjust without losing momentum.
      </p>
      <p>
        <img src="https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/09cabd9b-9728-4ee9-9e8b-e0cf01af8aeb/cd904493-cada-43d2-907d-1512cf870289/image.png" alt="Time management schedule">
      </p>
      
      <h3>Deep work / shallow work</h3>
      <h4>Deep work</h4>
      <p>
        Popularized by Cal Newport's "Deep Work," this concept involves eliminating distractions and dedicating focused, uninterrupted time—typically 4 hours—to tackle a single problem. Deep focus is like a muscle, growing stronger with regular training.
      </p>
      <p>
        In practice, deep work means being intentional about your environment: shutting down chat apps, putting your phone in another room, and ensuring you have water, coffee, and snacks. Interruptions or breaking focus to search for information can derail the session.
      </p>
      <h4>Shallow work</h4>
      <p>
        Shallow work consists of logistical or operational tasks such as meetings, emails, Slack conversations, and administrative work. While necessary, these tasks don't require intense focus and should be scheduled so they don't interfere with deep work.
      </p>
      
      <h3>Shutdown routine</h3>
      <p>
        After a long day of tasks and commitments, having a clear shutdown routine helps you mentally transition from work to personal life. Even during critical periods when I work 14-hour days, I take a shutdown break between shifts (6-8 hours) to reset, maintain productivity, and avoid burnout.
      </p>
      <p>
        This routine allows me to be fully present in personal activities—whether attending an art exhibition, exercising, or spending quality time with loved ones—and ensures I return to work with a positive attitude.
      </p>
      
      <h3>Small improvements</h3>
      <h4>Phone</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Run your phone in black and white.</li>
        <li>Limit social media use to 30 minutes per day (typically averaging 8 minutes daily).</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Computer</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Keep only the tabs and programs you actively need open.</li>
        <li>Disable notifications to avoid interruptions.</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Supplements</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>1g Ashwaganda to decrease cortisol levels and handle stress.</li>
        <li>160 ugs of vitamin D to avoid depression.</li>
        <li>50mg of quetiapine to help fall asleep.</li>
        <li>50ml of melatonin if you wake during the night for better sleep quality.</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Diet</h4>
      <p>
        Follow a low-carb, high-fat diet with no gluten, milk proteins, sugar, drugs, or alcohol — tailored to maximize personal performance.
      </p>
      <h4>Working out</h4>
